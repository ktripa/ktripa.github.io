I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in Hydrology and Water Resources Engineering at Texas A&M University, working with Professor Ashok Kumar Mishra. My research focuses on understanding and predicting hydroclimatic extremes through the integration of physical process understanding with advanced machine learning approaches.

Specifically, my work investigates the mechanisms driving flash droughts, compound drought-heatwave events, and their intensification under climate change. I develop physics-guided deep learning frameworks that combine domain knowledge with data-driven methods to improve prediction accuracy and interpretability. My research leverages large-scale reanalysis datasets (ERA5, GLEAM, NLDAS), land surface models (Noah-MP, VIC), and explainable AI techniques to understand land-atmosphere feedbacks and soil moisture dynamics.
